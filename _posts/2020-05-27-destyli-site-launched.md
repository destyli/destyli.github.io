Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. And hopefully this works
like notepad++ where I can just type and hit enter wherever I want to and focus on writing down my trains of thoughts.
