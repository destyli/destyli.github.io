This is the first post after the site-launch post. In this post I'd like to list things that I thought of that I'd like to blog
about. This is likely going to be a running list as I think of more things to cover:
<ul>
  <li>Work/Life Philosophical thoughts/ideas
  <li>Technology related topics
  <li>Computer simulation (esp. related to biochemical/neural signaling) related topics
  <li>Fun/Games
</ul>
